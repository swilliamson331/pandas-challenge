Analysis summary:
District Summary
- In the school district overall, students do better in reading class than math class on average
    - students if good in one subject, are less likely to be good in the other subject, as shown by the overall passing % being lower than either the mathh pass % or reading pass % by at least ~10%
School Summary
- District school students are much less likely to be passing overall than charter students
- charter schools are smaller than district schools 
- More takeaways on this to come in the further analysis done
Highest/Bottom Performing Schools
 - Better shows the first point in the above School summary analysis that charter overall passes much more than district , which was the most obvious takeaway to the naked eye of the school summary dataset
Math Scores by Grade
- Math scores at each school stay very consistent through all 4 years of school, with each school averaging between high 70's to low 80's
Reading Scores by Grade
- Also has consistent grades through all years of high school per school, and more consistent across all schools as well, with all high schools averaging in the low 80's
Scores by School Spending
- Opposite to what intuition would suggest, the higher the spending range is per student, the lower their grades. Math and reading scores go down with increased spending, with the drop even steeper on overall passing as the spending brackets go up.
Scores by School Size
- Large schools have the worst grades
- Small and Medium schools have almost equivalent grade performance
Scores by School Type
- Charter schools outperform district schools across the board
- District schools are closer to charter schools in terms of average grade, but have a much lower passing %, especially in math. This tells us that at district schools there is a lot more variabiolity in scores, with more students having below passing scores that bring down the average.

My 2 main conclusions:
- Charter schools fare better academically than district schools; This is likely correlated to the fact that small and medium schools outperform large schools. You could infer that this is due to smaller class sizes, and more intimate teaching, being more effective
- Reading is an easier subject for students than math; Reading scores on average a bit higher, but more significantly (in terms of gap between data points), students are more likely to pass reading than math. This gap is especially prevalent in large or district schools. In a point that builds off our first conclusion, smaller schools / a more intimate teaching environment is critical to students success, but especially in math.
